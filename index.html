    <h1>Guided by Eddie</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve always felt wrong for caring. Like healing and helping others meant I was weak, or off. In my world — the real estate world — too many worship vanity: the car, the suits, the coffee, the accolades. It’s a performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not performing. I’m not chasing clout. I’m not here for trophies. I am here to love, to serve, and to heal. I’m building something that feels real — because I am real. What you see on social is who you’ll meet in person. No filters.

    <h2>The Ripple Project</h2>
    <p>
      Every transaction plants a seed. Ten percent of my commission — and hopefully more — goes directly toward community impact: food, housing, healing. Clients are invited to guide where that money goes, based on what matters to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd rather be the realtor known for feeding 2,000 people than just selling 200 homes. That’s what Ripple means.

    <h2>Raised in CHI</h2>
    <p>
      This is a storytelling project. We interview real people — neighbors, elders, barbers, immigrants, artists — who make Chicago what it is. We ask deeper questions: Why are you here? What shaped your path? What truth are you living?
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not for likes. It’s to build bridges — and help each other.

    <h2>Guided by Eddie & The Relatable Fool</h2>
    <p>
      Guided by Eddie is my daily presence. When you buy, rent, or sell, I want you to feel seen — not sold. You will be educated, not manipulated. This is compassion over commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Relatable Fool is my shadow voice — the raw truths, the questions, the moments I share that others won’t. I speak the things many feel but won’t say. It’s how we question reality, philosophy, and find truth together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, I want people to know they are not alone. Through my actions, ideas, and presence — I’ll remind you that you matter.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Because I never wanted the same things everyone else did. I was told I was wrong for caring. I’ve been hurt, misunderstood, overlooked — but I’ve accepted my heart. And with it, I’ve built this.
    </p>
    <p>
      While others chase applause, I’m chasing restoration. Of community. Of truth. Of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my offering.
