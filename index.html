      <h1>🌀 Guided by Eddie™</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the mirror.<br>
      This isn’t a brand. This is me — living out loud, leading with heart, and refusing to fake it.<br>
      I’m Eddie Ortiz, the "three-star realtor" on purpose.<br>
      Not because I don’t do the work — but because I don’t need gold stars to know I matter.<br>
      I don’t wear suits. I don’t chase scripts. I serve people — not egos.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>🌍 Why This Exists</h2>
      <p>The world feels upside down. Too many people chasing clout, views, and fake smiles.<br>
      Too few people asking: Who’s actually helping? Who's actually healing?</p>

      <p>I used to think something was wrong with me for caring this much. For trying to heal. For wanting more than just money and milestones.</p>

      <p>But now I know better.<br>
      That’s why I finally accepted my heart — and from it, I built two things:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Guided by Eddie™</strong>: my real estate movement, rooted in service, community, and healing.</li>
        <li><strong>The Relatable Fool™</strong>: a living philosophy of radical honesty, asking the questions most people are too afraid to voice.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I use <strong>The Relatable Fool</strong> to challenge the systems we’ve inherited. To spark curiosity. To make people feel seen.<br>
      I ask the questions you’re probably already asking yourself — the ones you didn’t know you were allowed to say out loud.</p>

      <p>I don’t claim to have the answers. But I’ll share my truth so we can walk toward it together.</p>

      <h2>🌊 The Ripple Project™</h2>
      <p>Every transaction plants a seed.<br>
      10% of my commission goes directly back into the community — toward causes my clients care about.<br>
      Whether it’s food, housing, elder care, or school supplies, we turn every deal into a ripple.</p>

      <p>This is real estate for the soul.<br>
      It’s my way of turning keys into connection.</p>

      <p>Along the way, I want you to know — you’re not alone.<br>
      I’ll keep showing you my heart, my love, my ideas... and I’ll be fully myself, for you.</p>

      <p>I’d rather be known as the realtor who helped feed 2,000 people than the one who sold 200 homes.</p>

      <h2>📜 What I Believe</h2>
      <p>The five-star system rewards polish. I reward presence.<br>
      Some people build to be admired. I build to make a dent.<br>
      I’d rather show up broke with integrity than show up rich with nothing to say.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking for real estate wrapped in love, you’re in the right place.<br>
      If you’re looking for a movement that puts people first — come closer.</p>

      <p>This isn’t a funnel. This is an invitation.<br>
      The Ripple Is Real. Come feel it.</p>

      <p>— Eddie</p>
