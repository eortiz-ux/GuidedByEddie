    <h1>The Ripple Starts with Presence</h1>
    <p>This isn’t a brand, this is a movement.</p>

    <h2>Built for the Overlooked</h2>
    <p>Raised in Chicago, forged in service, guided by pain but not defined by it. This space is for those who were told they care too much, and for anyone trying to heal what they did not break.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Guided by Eddie</h2>
    <p>I have always been this way, I just finally accepted my heart. I serve clients by being human first, agent second. I am not here to look better than you, I am here to serve you. Impact matters more than image.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Relatable Fool</h2>
    <p>A mirror and a philosopher. A voice that questions the rules we have been taught. Through storytelling and truth, I share thoughts that awaken yours — not to convince, but to connect.</p>
    <p class="quote">Not polished, not perfect, just real.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="section-divider"></div>

  <section>
    <h2>The Ripple Project</h2>
    <p>Every home I help close fuels community care. <span class="highlight">10% of my commission</span>, and often more, is reinvested into what <span class="highlight">you</span> care about. Micro grants, local food programs, dignity for the forgotten.</p>
    <p class="quote">Every closing feeds someone, heals someone, and loves someone who’s forgotten.</p>
    <p class="muted">It is not charity, it is restoration.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="section-divider"></div>

  <section>
    <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
    <p>You are not alone anymore. We are here together. This will be our platform, a movement of healing, rebuilding, and remembering. Let us build systems that remind people they matter.</p>
