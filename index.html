    <h1>Guided by Eddie™</h1>
    <p class="tagline">This isn’t a brand — it’s a movement.</p>
    <p><strong>I’m Eddie Ortiz</strong>, the first three-star realtor by choice. Not because I don’t close deals — but because I’m not chasing stars, suits, or trophies. I’m here to serve. I’m here to love. I’m here to heal.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>🌎 Why This Exists</h2>
    <p>Because the world is backwards. While others race for clout, I’m racing to restore what was stolen. I choose my community. I believe they’ll take care of me — because I take care of them.</p>
    <p>This site is a portal to something different. Not polished. Not perfect. Just real.</p>

    <h2>🌀 What I’ve Built</h2>
    <h3>Guided by Eddie™</h3>
    <p>A human-first real estate identity. No suits, no scripts. Just presence, transparency, and real connection. If I help you buy or sell a home, I want you to feel like <em>you were seen</em> — not sold.</p>

    <h3>The Ripple Project™</h3>
    <p>Every transaction is a seed. A portion of every deal goes back into feeding, housing, or supporting someone else. We host events, give away groceries, sponsor healing spaces, and remind people they matter. Ripple closings are different.</p>

    <h3>Raised in CHI™</h3>
    <p>A storytelling + community podcast series. I interview neighbors, immigrants, artists, barbers, elders, and the people who make Chicago what it is. No filters. Just truth.</p>

    <h3>Relatable Fool™</h3>
    <p>The honest shadow. Where I post raw thoughts, half-finished ideas, mistakes, and mirror reflections. Because we don’t grow from pretending — we grow from being seen.</p>

    <h2>📜 Philosophy</h2>
    <div class="quote">
      “I’d rather be Diogenes with a lamp than a Top Producer with a mask.”
    </div>
    <p>Too many realtors worship vanity metrics. I’m not building that way.</p>

    <p><strong>The Five-Star Trap:</strong><br />It rewards performance, not presence.</p>

    <p><strong>My Truth:</strong><br />The awards are not for me. The people are. The mission is.</p>

    <p>I’m choosing to build something different — and I know others are watching.</p>
