  <h1>🌀 Guided by Eddie™</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the mirror.<br/>
  This isn’t a brand.<br/>
  This is me — living out loud, leading with heart, and refusing to fake it.</p>

  <p>I’m Eddie Ortiz — the “three-star realtor” on purpose.<br/>
  Not because I don’t do the work.<br/>
  But because I don’t need gold stars to know I matter.</p>

  <p>I don’t wear suits.<br/>
  I don’t chase scripts.<br/>
  I serve people — not egos.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🌍 Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>Because too many people are hurting.<br/>
    Because the industry forgot what it means to care.<br/>
    Because I’ve seen what happens when no one shows up — so I decided to be the one who does.</p>
    <p>This is real estate rooted in healing, not just houses.<br/>
    This is connection over commission.<br/>
    This is for the people who’ve been overlooked, priced out, or made to feel like they don’t belong.<br/>
    You do.<br/>
    Right here.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧩 What I’m Creating</h2>

    <h3>Guided by Eddie™</h3>
    <p>This is my real estate identity — raw, human, community-first.<br/>
    I help people move, yes. But more than that — I help people feel seen.<br/>
    If we work together, you’ll know exactly what’s happening, you’ll feel heard, and you’ll be respected. Always.</p>

    <h3>The Ripple Project™</h3>
    <p>Every closing I do, I give back — food, help, healing, love.<br/>
    We host events, sponsor groceries, support families, and create space for people to breathe again.<br/>
    A Ripple closing means someone else is being lifted as you close your deal.<br/>
    This ain’t a gimmick. This is legacy.</p>

    <h3>Raised in CHI™</h3>
    <p>The city raised me — so I’m giving it a mic.<br/>
    I interview barbers, elders, immigrants, activists, and neighbors.<br/>
    No filters. No fluff. Just truth from the block.<br/>
    This is Chicago — the one you don’t see on postcards.</p>

    <h3>Relatable Fool™</h3>
    <p>This is the part of me that speaks before it’s clean.<br/>
    Before it’s branded. Before it’s understood.<br/>
    It’s where I post the mess, the mirrors, the journal entries.<br/>
    Because I’m not here to pretend. I’m here to be seen.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📜 What I Believe</h2>
    <p>The five-star system rewards polish.<br/>
    I reward presence.</p>
    <p>Some people build to be admired.<br/>
    I build to make a dent.</p>
    <p>I’d rather show up broke with integrity than show up rich with nothing to say.</p>
    <p>So if you’re looking for real estate wrapped in love, you’re in the right place.<br/>
    If you’re looking for a movement that puts people first — come closer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧠 Want to Talk?</h2>
    <p>Text me. DM me. Come through to a Ripple event.<br/>
    No pressure. No pitch. Just people.</p>
    <p>This isn’t a funnel.<br/>
    This is an invitation.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="signature">The Ripple Is Real.<br/>Come feel it.<br/>— Eddie</p>
