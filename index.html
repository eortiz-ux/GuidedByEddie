    <p>Turning Trust Into Action. One Closing at a Time.</p>

    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t just another realtor site. This is a <span class="highlight">movement</span>. 
      I use real estate to fund healing, hope, and hyperlocal impact. Through every transaction, we give back, tell stories, and restore what was lost.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Vision & Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Eddie. I’m a community-first realtor, storyteller, and what some call a Relatable Fool — someone who chooses compassion over clout.
      I built this because I got tired of waiting for someone else to come back for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe real estate can be a tool for restoration, not just revenue. My movement is rooted in showing up where systems fail — feeding families, showing up to funerals, housing the unheard, and building bridges where there were only cracks.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Guided by Eddie™?</h2>
    <p>
      Guided by Eddie™ is the public-facing heartbeat of everything I do — real estate with soul. I don’t wear suits to impress you. I show up to serve, to stand with you, and to walk you home.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What is the Ripple Project™?</h2>
    <p>
      The Ripple Project is my giveback system — every deal funds acts of service. That includes:
      groceries, back-to-school drives, wheelchairs for elders, funeral support, and more. It’s how we turn transactions into trust.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>What is Raised in CHI™?</h2>
    <p>
      Raised in CHI™ is the storytelling series. It’s where I amplify voices from the block to the barbershop. We talk about struggle, legacy, and what it means to be raised in a city that tries to chew you up and forget your name. I make sure that doesn’t happen.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Who is The Relatable Fool™?</h2>
    <p>
      That’s me too. It’s my shadow side. It’s where I journal publicly, mess up publicly, and remind you that you don’t need to be perfect to be powerful. The Fool reminds us that presence is worth more than polish.
    </p>

    <h2>Work With Me</h2>
    <p>
      Buying? Selling? Just looking for someone to trust? Let’s talk. I’m not here to sell you a house. I’m here to walk with you until you feel <em>home</em>.
